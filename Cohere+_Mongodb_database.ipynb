            "Jamie: If someone consistently disrespects your boundaries, it might be a sign of an unhealthy relationship. It's important to stand firm and remind them of your boundaries. If they still don't respect them, you might need to reconsider the relationship.\n",

(A Definition)\\n\\nWhen you think about the word boundary, you might have an image of a fence or of a border come to your mind. The fence might be used to keep two things separate from each other or to provide protection from another entity. \\n\\nWhile this idea of a boundary is clear cut, psychological boundaries—or the standard by which we want people to treat us—are harder to identify. Psychological boundaries are also less fixed and change depending on circumstances such as the situation, one’s values, and cognitive, physical, or emotional capacity. \\u200bBefore we get started, we thought you might be interested in taking our well-being quiz to get your free personalized report.\\u200b Or, if you're a well-being entrepreneur or coach, download our Wellness Business Growth eBook to get expert tips, tools, and resources to grow your business fast.\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\n\\nAre You a Therapist, Coach, or Wellness Entrepreneur?\\n\\nFree eBook to Learn How to Grow Your Wellness Business Exponentially!\\n\\n ✓ Save hundreds of hours of time ✓ Earn more $ faster \\u200b✓ Boost your credibility ✓ Deliver high-impact content \\n\\nIn her YouTube video, Dr. Ramani discusses the concept of psychological boundaries and some examples where they show up such as:\\n\\nPhysical boundaries:\\n\\nHow close to sit next to a person \\n\\nIf you can hug a person\\n\\nBehavioral boundaries:\\n\\nType of language to use\\n\\nWhen to turn off your phone\\n\\nAppropriate topics to discuss\\n\\nPersonally triggering topics \\n\\nManipulation Dr. Ramani further states how difficult it is to reinforce boundaries with certain individuals such as people with narcissistic tendencies.\\n\\nVideo: Good Boundaries Free You\\u200b\\n\\nWhat Are Healthy Boundaries?\\n\\nHealthy boundaries are important for all types of relationships and setting boundaries is considered an important relationship skill (Cherry et al, 2021, Ciarrochi, Bilich, & Godsell, 2010, Davila et al, 2017, Ennenbach, 2014). Hallmarks of healthy boundaries include:\\n\\nInsight and self-awareness Insight and self-awareness are the abilities to understand your own motivations, needs, values\\u200b and more. Having strong insight is an important part of any relationship, and especially healthy romantic relationships (Davila et al, 2017). Insight allows us to understand ourselves better and to communicate our needs to our family, friends, and partners. Without insight we may not understand or even be able to identify our boundaries.\\n\\nAcceptance Acceptance, in the context of talking about boundaries, is embracing the belief that everybody has needs and that those needs are important. Acceptance allows us to hold that our needs are important as well as meeting the needs of the people around us (Davila et al, 2017, Ennenbach, 2014). Acceptance is also important when considering the reality of the situation in which we are thinking about setting a boundary. We would practice accepting characteristics or constraints about the situation (it’s nighttime, I’m busy, everything is always urgent with this person) and how it impacts our own thoughts and feelings (Ciarrochi, Bilich, & Godsell, 2010).\\n\\nPsychological flexibility When we are rigid in our emotions, behaviors, and thoughts we experience psychological inflexibility (Cherry et al, 2021, Ciarrochi, Bilich, & Godsell, 2010). Psychological inflexibility is a risk factor for experiencing mental health challenges such as anxiety and depression (Cherry et al, 2021, Ciarrochi, Bilich, & Godsell, 2010). Moreover it can prevent us from living in a way that is intentionally aligned with our own values and goals (Ciarrochi, Bilich, & Godsell, 2010). Psychological flexibility, on the other hand, is when we accept the reality of the situation, accept our own thoughts, feelings, emotions, and consider our values—all of which informs our behavior for that given moment (Cherry et al, 2021, Ciarrochi, Bilich, & Godsell, 2010). We use psychological flexibility to create and communicate boundaries for each situation rather than imposing a one size fits all approach.\\n\\nBoundaries in Relationships\\n\\nAs mentioned before, boundaries are a part of all healthy relationships, whether romantic, familial, social, or professional. What a boundary looks like, however, is influenced by many factors including culture. The idea of a boundary or a person being a bounded, distinct, and separate entity does not align with the worldview of some cultures. \\u200b For example, in many Eastern Cultures, the concept of the self (or the individual as we understand it in Western Psychology) is deemphasized or even discouraged (Shiah, 2016). Therefore, having individualistic desires, needs, or wants may not be as integral to people in these cultures. In fact, it is perfectly healthy and normal to uphold a collective mindset. Boundaries in this case may not look as firm or fixed, but can still include insight to one’s own values (personal, cultural, and collective), acceptance of respecting others needs, and psychological flexibility to consider the specific situation.\\n\\nWhy Are Boundaries Important?\\n\\nWhen we think about boundaries as only something that separates ourselves from others, we forget that boundaries can also be a way to connect deeper to ourselves and the people around us. Sometimes we need boundaries to protect ourselves, especially from people that seem to disrespect others (e.g. narcissists, abusers). However, by practicing and cultivating our own insight and awareness, we can get to know ourselves in a deeper way and share that with our partners, friends, and family. Boundaries can be a way of demonstrating compassion towards yourself and compassion towards others. When we don’t respect our own boundaries or another person’s boundaries, we can become psychologically disconnected. Doing this long-term can lead to feeling defeated, unworthy, resentful, and lonely.\\n\\nHow to Set Boundaries\\n\\nHere are some questions to consider when thinking about setting boundaries:\\n\\nInsight and awareness\\n\\nWhat are your most important values?\\n\\nHow are they informed by life experience and culture?\\n\\nWhat are some needs specific to you (e.g. alone time, regular meals, weekly book club)? Consider needs that if not met leave you feeling depleted.\\n\\nAre any of these needs informed by experiences of trauma?\\n\\nWhat are the needs and values of the people you are considering setting a boundary with?\\n\\nWhat is the reality of the situation, how are your boundaries likely to be received?\\n\\nHow are your thoughts and feelings impacted by the situation?\\n\\nWhat is your capacity (emotional, physical, and other) at this moment? \\n\\nPsychological Flexibility\\n\\nIf you decide to say no to a request due to limited capacity, is there something else you can offer within your capacity?\\n\\nAre you feeling emotionally or mentally rigid? If so, does your response fit this situation?\\n\\nAre any past experiences, trauma, or memories influencing your boundaries? Is that feeling aligned with your own values and goals?\\n\\nIf your boundaries are not respected, what are some possible responses you might have to protect yourself? \\n\\nWhat are different ways you can communicate your boundaries to others?\\n\\nIt is 5:30 PM and you’re getting ready to wrap up work within half an hour. Your boss comes by and asks you to work on a project tonight. You estimate the task she’s asking you to complete will take an additional two more hours. You didn’t sleep well the night before and did not have time to prepare a meal for lunch and have been sustaining yourself with coffee and snacks. \\n\\nSome questions to consider:\\n\\nWhat are some needs specific to you (e.g. alone time, regular meals, weekly book club)?\\n\\nWhat is your capacity (emotional, physical, and other) at this moment?\\n\\nWhat is the reality of the situation? How are your boundaries likely to be received?\\n\\nIf you decide to say no to a request due to limited capacity, is there something else you can offer within your capacity? After considering the questions, you are reminded that you really value and need at least seven hours of sleep to function well otherwise your mood drops. You tend to get hungry frequently and have a fast metabolism. The reality of the situation is that there have been several layoffs this year and you need the income, but also have a small savings account. Your boss is very challenging but has shown some compassion in the past. \\n\\nPossible Responses: Response 1: You tell your boss you are willing to complete the task tonight and plan to take a break at 6 PM to find dinner and relax for half an hour. After that, you plan to complete your task and be done by 8:30 PM. Response 2: You tell your boss you are unable to work on the project tonight but plan on getting up early tomorrow to work on it. Response 3: You expressed gratitude to your boss for considering you on this project and share that you are unable to work on the project tonight, as you are not feeling well today. You gently remind her that you are committed to the team and have worked on several other tasks during off-hours earlier this week. You recommend she asks another colleague.\\n\\nBoundaries: Definition, Examples & How To Set Them\\n\\nBoundaries With Family\\n\\nYou generally enjoy talking to your parents and make it a point to call them every week. You have been with the same partner for over a decade and are in your late 30s. Usually, your mom brings up the topic of having children during every conversation and tells you how much she wants to be a grandparent. You have already told her you do not want to have children but she continues to bring up this conversation.\\n\\nSome questions to consider:\\n\\nWhat are your most important values?\\n\\nWhat are the needs and values of the people you are considering setting a boundary with?\\n\\nHow are your thoughts and feelings impacted by the situation?\\n\\nIf your boundaries are not respected, what are some possible responses you might have to protect yourself? \\n\\nWhat are different ways you can communicate your boundaries to others? After considering the questions, you recognize that you and your mom both value family. You also value your autonomy and the environment, which are two factors that influenced your choice to not have children. You feel stigmatized when your mom repeatedly asks you and your partner about having children. \\n\\nPossible Responses: Response 1: You ask your mom to join you separately for lunch or a video call. You reflect on your shared family values and express gratitude for the support she has given you. You share your feelings about deciding to not have children and the impact it has when she continuously brings up the question. You ask her to not bring up the question again. Response 2: During one of your phone conversations, your mom asks you again about having children. You share with her that you are aware of how meaningful it would be for her to have grandchildren, but that you have already decided with your partner to not have children. You share how this question makes you feel. You let her know that if she decides to bring up the topic again, you will gently remind her that you do not feel comfortable with this topic, and if she continues to bring up the topic you will excuse yourself from the conversation and try talking to her another day.\\n\\nQuotes About Boundaries\\n\\n\\u200b“Boundaries are the distance at which I can love you and me simultaneously.” Prentis Hemphill\\n\\n“Many survivors are used to the ‘wait and see’ tactic which only leaves them vulnerable to a second attack. As your boundaries get stronger, the wait time gets shorter. You never have justify your intuition.”- Shahida Arabi\\n\\n“Givers need to set limits because takers rarely do.”- Rachel Wolchin\\n\\n“Boundaries need to be communicated first verbally and then with actions.”- Henry Cloud\\n\\n“What I most regretted were my silences. Of what had I ever been afraid?”- Audre Lorde\\n\\nArticles Related to Boundaries\\u200b\\n\\nHere are some more articles to read that can help you understand boundaries:\\n\\n\\u200bAssertive Communication: Definition, Examples, & Techniques\\n\\nBoundaries In Relationships: Definition, Benefits, & Examples\\n\\nAre You an Empath? 10 Empathic Traits\\n\\n\\u200bPassive Aggression: Definition, Examples, & Behaviors\\n\\nBooks & Products Related to Boundaries\\u200b\\n\\nWant to keep learning about boundaries?

            "Psychological flexibility When we are rigid in our emotions, behaviors, and thoughts we experience psychological inflexibility (Cherry et al, 2021, Ciarrochi, Bilich, & Godsell, 2010). Psychological inflexibility is a risk factor for experiencing mental health challenges such as anxiety and depression (Cherry et al, 2021, Ciarrochi, Bilich, & Godsell, 2010). Moreover it can prevent us from living in a way that is intentionally aligned with our own values and goals (Ciarrochi, Bilich, & Godsell, 2010). Psychological flexibility, on the other hand, is when we accept the reality of the situation, accept our own thoughts, feelings, emotions, and consider our values—all of which informs our behavior for that given moment (Cherry et al, 2021, Ciarrochi, Bilich, & Godsell, 2010). We use psychological flexibility to create and communicate boundaries for each situation rather than imposing a one size fits all approach.\n",

            "As mentioned before, boundaries are a part of all healthy relationships, whether romantic, familial, social, or professional. What a boundary looks like, however, is influenced by many factors including culture. The idea of a boundary or a person being a bounded, distinct, and separate entity does not align with the worldview of some cultures. ​ For example, in many Eastern Cultures, the concept of the self (or the individual as we understand it in Western Psychology) is deemphasized or even discouraged (Shiah, 2016). Therefore, having individualistic desires, needs, or wants may not be as integral to people in these cultures. In fact, it is perfectly healthy and normal to uphold a collective mindset. Boundaries in this case may not look as firm or fixed, but can still include insight to one’s own values (personal, cultural, and collective), acceptance of respecting others needs, and psychological flexibility to consider the specific situation.\n",

            "Why Are Boundaries Important?\n",
            "\n",
            "When we think about boundaries as only something that separates ourselves from others, we forget that boundaries can also be a way to connect deeper to ourselves and the people around us. Sometimes we need boundaries to protect ourselves, especially from people that seem to disrespect others (e.g. narcissists, abusers). However, by practicing and cultivating our own insight and awareness, we can get to know ourselves in a deeper way and share that with our partners, friends, and family. Boundaries can be a way of demonstrating compassion towards yourself and compassion towards others. When we don’t respect our own boundaries or another person’s boundaries, we can become psychologically disconnected. Doing this long-term can lead to feeling defeated, unworthy, resentful, and lonely.\n",

You might think of something like a property line or the defining lines of a shape. Boundaries show where one thing ends and another begins. Boundaries in a relationship are kind of like this; they help each person figure out where one person ends and the other begins. In short, boundaries help you define what you are comfortable with and how you would like to be treated by others. They apply to any kind of relationship you have – whether with a friend, family member, partner or anyone else in your life.\\n\\nWhat are my boundaries?\\n\\nEven though we talk about them in relation to other people, in some ways boundaries are really about your relationship with yourself; they help you honor your needs, goals, feelings and values. Boundaries can be emotional, physical or even digital. Some examples of personal boundaries might be:\\n\\nI’m cool with following each other on social media, but not with sharing passwords\\n\\nI’m comfortable kissing and holding hands, but not in public\\n\\nI’m okay with regularly texting, but I don’t want to text multiple times in an hour\\n\\nI want to spend time with my friends/family on weekends\\n\\nI need quiet time to myself every day\\n\\nI’m comfortable with some touching, but I’m not ready to have sex\\n\\nIt can be helpful to think through your own boundaries, no matter what your relationship status is. Start by paying attention to how you feel about and react to situations around you, whether in real life or in shows or movies you watch. What makes you feel uncomfortable? What’s important to you? What do you want to keep private? Is there any type of behavior or trait that would not fly with you, ever (sometimes called a “dealbreaker”)? It might be helpful to write down some of your thoughts.\\n\\nCommunicating boundaries\\n\\nHow can you and your partner know each other’s boundaries? By talking about them! Communication is really key in a healthy relationship, and boundaries are an important part of an ongoing conversation between you and your partner. Talking about boundaries can happen whenever, wherever! If your partner does something that you like or don’t like, let them know. A simple, “Hey, I really like it when you…” or “I’m not comfortable when we…” lets them know what’s up. In a healthy relationship, partners respect each other’s boundaries once they’ve been communicated. And if you’re ever not clear on your partner’s boundaries, just ask! Questions like “Is this okay?” or “Are you cool with this?” can help jumpstart the conversation. Just remember: if you don’t want to talk about your boundaries with your partner because you’re afraid they’ll react with anger or violence, that’s a warning sign that your relationship might be unhealthy or abusive.\\n\\nHealthy vs. unhealthy boundaries\\n\\nHow do you know if a boundary is healthy…or not? It’s important to recognize that healthy boundaries help to protect and respect you; an unhealthy boundary seeks to control or harm someone else. A healthy boundary would be: “I need space to hang out with my friends and do things I enjoy on my own.” But if your partner says, “I need you to stop talking to other guys/girls because you might cheat/I get jealous,” that’s not a healthy boundary; it’s a warning sign that your partner may have some trust issues and is trying to control who you hang out with. Here are some more great examples of healthy/unhealthy boundaries!\\n\\nCan boundaries change?\\n\\nCan your boundaries change over time? Yes! It’s normal for boundaries to shift as we gain more life experience or get more comfortable in our relationships. We might not be okay with something at the beginning of a relationship, but we might be totally cool with it a few months down the line. On the other hand, we might realize something crosses a boundary for us after experiencing it for the first time. Every person has the right to change their mind about what their boundaries are at any time. What’s important is that you’re communicating any boundary changes to your partner and you’re making changes because YOU want to, not because you’re being pressured, forced or manipulated into making them.\\n\\nYou deserve to be safe and respected, and boundaries play a big part in creating healthy relationships that let you be YOU.

In a sense, that’s true. But boundaries aren’t necessarily a bad thing. In fact, they’re an important ingredient in healthy, balanced relationships. They’re also a crucial part of maintaining your identity, mental health, and physical well-being. \\n\\nBoundaries can include restrictions on physical actions, such as asking a roommate or partner not to look through your phone or not to interrupt when you’re working from home. They can also be psychological, such as asking your spouse to accept that your goals and dreams may not always be the same as theirs.\\n\\nHealthy boundaries serve to:\\n\\nEncourage autonomy and reduce codependent habits.\\n\\nSet expectations when interacting with others.\\n\\nGive you a sense of empowerment and self-respect.\\n\\nEnsure your physical and emotional comfort.\\n\\nClarify individual responsibilities in a relationship.\\n\\nSeparate your wants, needs, thoughts, and feelings from those of others.\\n\\nWithout healthy boundaries, your relationships can become toxic and unsatisfying and your well-being can suffer. You might feel taken advantage of if a friend keeps asking for money, for example, or feel overwhelmed by stress if you feel the need to solve all of your partner’s emotional problems. Or if a parent continually invades your privacy, you’ll likely feel resentful. Similarly, if you continually ignore another person’s boundaries, you risk making them feel uncomfortable and damaging the relationship.\\n\\nBoundaries aren’t just necessary in your personal relationships, though. They’re also needed in the workplace, where coworkers or managers might monopolize your time or disregard your needs. Unhealthy boundaries at work can also follow you home and reduce the quality of your personal life.\\n\\nOne study showed that when boundaries are blurred between personal life and work, people experience more emotional exhaustion and less happiness. On the other hand, setting boundaries, particularly when it comes to job duties, can lead to a greater sense of empowerment.\\n\\nLearning how to set and maintain boundaries can change many aspects of your life, ranging from work to family relations to dating. It all starts with understanding the difference between healthy and unhealthy boundaries.\\n\\nTypes of healthy boundaries\\n\\nPersonal boundaries can come in many forms. However, not every relationship requires you to address every type of boundary. For example, you might need to set physical restrictions with a coworker but not financial ones.\\n\\nPhysical boundaries help keep you comfortable and safe, not just when you’re dealing with strangers, but also when you’re interacting with those closest to you. For example, you might tell someone that you’d prefer handshakes instead of hugs. Or you could tell a friend that you need to take a rest during a lengthy bike ride. If a physical space belongs to you, you can set limitations around that as well. Perhaps you don’t want someone to intrude in your bedroom or clutter your office with their items.\\n\\nSexual boundaries could involve anything from asking for consent before being physically intimate to checking in with your partner’s comfort level during sex. Even if you’ve been with your partner for years, you should make an ongoing habit of communicating your preferences. You might want to reassess limitations and expectations surrounding things like frequency of sex and contraception use.\\n\\nEmotional boundaries ensure that others are respectful of your emotional well- being and internal comfort level. When setting an emotional boundary, you might say something like, “I don’t want to talk about this subject while I’m at work because I need to focus.” You might also use these barriers to prevent yourself from feeling overwhelmed by other people’s feelings. For example, you can acknowledge you’re not responsible for how another person reacts to your decision to turn them down for a second date.\\n\\nMaterial/financial boundaries extend to your belongings, such as money, clothing, car, or home. If you’re a charitable person, you might have a hard time saying “no” to people who want to borrow items. However, people may intentionally or unintentionally take advantage of your goodwill, and then you may notice your own resentment building. When setting a material restriction, you might say something like, “You can borrow my phone charger, but please put it back when you’re done” or “No, I can’t loan you money for new shoes.”\\n\\n[Read: Coping with Financial Stress]\\n\\nTime boundaries allow you to focus on your priorities at work and in your personal life without feeling crowded by other people’s needs and wants. Imagine that you’ve had a stressful work week and want to spend the weekend recuperating. You might decline a party invite or set a limit on how long you’ll be there. Other time-related restrictions could include asking a friend to avoid calling you during work hours or asking a partner to delay an important conversation until a more convenient time.\\n\\nBoundaries aren’t etched in stone. You’ll need to adjust them as circumstances change and relationships grow. This can be especially true in long-term relationships. Communication is important as you reevaluate and revise your boundaries. You want the other person to be clear on the change and the reason behind it.\\n\\nExamples of shifting boundaries\\n\\nYou initially have loose financial boundaries with family members and help them pay bills when necessary.\\n\\nYou lost your job, so you decide to set tighter boundaries to protect your financial well-being.\\n\\nYou often agree to work extra weekend hours to help a coworker.\\n\\nYou cut back on hours so you can spend more time with your newborn.\\n\\nYou allow a friend to vent their emotions to you daily.\\n\\nThe oversharing of information affects your mental health, so you set a limit on how often you talk about the subject.\\n\\nYou and your partner have sex multiple times a week.\\n\\nYour sex drive changes, and you ask your partner if the two of you can focus on different forms of intimacy.\\n\\nYou allow your brother-in-law to temporarily use your garage for storage.\\n\\nYou need the space for your own needs, so you talk to him about relocating his items.\\n\\nUnhealthy boundaries\\n\\nUnhealthy boundaries often tend to be either too rigid or too porous. Healthy ones fall somewhere between these two extremes.\\n\\nRigid boundaries keep other people at a distance, even loved ones. Maybe you refuse to talk about your emotions with your partner or rarely set aside time to meet with friends.\\n\\nPorous or weak boundaries develop when you have a hard time saying “no” to others. For example, you might be too willing to take on all the responsibilities in a relationship. Or maybe you tend to overshare when talking with strangers.\\n\\nThere are many reasons why people may consistently struggle with unhealthy boundaries, such as:\\n\\nDesire for control. Some people use boundaries to manipulate others. For example, a person might use rigid boundaries to stonewall conversations, refusing to engage with you until you do what they want.\\n\\nFear of rejection. If you’re afraid of a romantic partner walking out of your life because of your flaws, you might hesitate to be emotionally open with them.\\n\\nLack of experience with setting limitations. If you grew up surrounded by people who set poor personal boundaries, managing proper ones can be a challenge. You might think that invading other people’s personal space is normal because your parents and siblings regularly did it to you.\\n\\nOverly agreeable personality. If you’re too eager to please other people, you might allow them to do things that make you uncomfortable. Maybe you regularly overcommit to activities or agree to help people because you simply want to be loved and accepted.\\n\\nLow self-esteem. You might feel as if your needs and wants aren’t worth vocalizing, or that you don’t have an identity of your own. Instead, you prioritize what other people want. As a result, people fail to recognize your discomfort.\\n\\nBoundaries and enabling behavior\\n\\nWhen someone you love is dealing with addiction, you may need to shift your boundaries to avoid enabling their behavior. Enabling is when you shield someone from the consequences of their actions. For example, you might want to offer to pay their legal bills for a DUI or lie to other people to cover up evidence of a gambling or drug addiction. These kinds of actions may seem helpful in the moment, but you’re actually preventing your loved one from learning from their mistakes.\\n\\n[Read: Helping Someone with a Drug Addiction]\\n\\nEnabling isn’t limited to situations that involve addiction. It can happen in other mental health issues. For example, if your loved has social anxiety disorder, you may try to shield them from uncomfortable interactions by speaking up for them in pubic. The result is that they continue to rely on you instead of addressing the issue on their own.\\n\\nHow to set and maintain boundaries\\n\\nWhile it’s usually best to start setting boundaries early on in a relationship, establishing healthy rules and limitations can help strengthen a relationship at any stage.\\n\\nIn many cases, you may not even realize a certain restriction is needed until you get to know each other more. For example, it might take you some time to realize that a coworker is regularly distracting you while on the job or that a romantic interest seems too controlling.\\n\\nThe following tips can help you establish boundaries if you are experiencing trouble communicating or connecting with a person in your life.\\n\\nSetting boundaries tip 1: Know what you want in a relationship\\n\\nWhether the relationship is romantic or platonic, it’s hard to have your needs met if you don’t know what they are. Reflecting on your values and beliefs is a good place to start.\\n\\nAsk yourself questions like:\\n\\nWhat traits do I like to see in other relationships?\\n\\nWhat behaviors bother me?\\n\\nWhat qualities do I admire in others?\\n\\nWhat material items matter the most to me and why?\\n\\nHow do I like to spend my time?\\n\\nWhat makes me feel fulfilled?\\n\\nBy gaining a more thorough understanding of yourself, you can begin to imagine the types of boundaries you need. If you know that you value independence, you’ll likely want to set financial rules between you and a partner. If you value high productivity or privacy, you might set physical boundaries with coworkers who tend to wander into your workspace.\\n\\nAssessing how you feel with someone\\n\\nThinking about how others make you feel can also help you identify necessary boundaries. After interacting with other people, reflect on your feelings by asking yourself questions.\\n\\nDid the other person make jokes or comments that made you feel disrespected?\\n\\nDid they do anything that made you physically uncomfortable or unsafe, such as raise their voice in anger?\\n\\nDid you feel pressured to do things that didn’t match your values?\\n\\nDid you feel overwhelmed by the person’s requests or expectations of you?\\n\\nDid you feel as if they were infringing on your sense of control or infantilizing you?\\n\\nA moment of reflection can help you decide whether you need to set limitations with the person in the future.\\n\\nTip 2: Talk to the person about your needs\\n\\nKnowing how to effectively communicate your needs to others is important. Rushed conversations, poor wording, and vague requests can make it harder for loved ones to understand and respect your ground rules.\\n\\nConsider timing. The best time to set a boundary with your partner is when you both feel relaxed and can focus on the conversation. If you’re mid-argument, try cooling down and circling back to the conversation once you’re both calm.\\n\\nBe prepared. Nervous about discussing your needs? Write your points down before the discussion so that you can speak clearly about your needs.\\n\\nConsider the delivery. Try to use “I” statements to convey how you feel. Avoid “you” statements, which can seem accusatory. For example, say, “I felt overwhelmed with the amount of work I had to take care of while you were away.” Expressing your emotions is a great way to start laying the groundwork for a relationship boundary.\\n\\nBe clear. A vague request, such as, “I’d like more personal space” may get the message across, but it’s better to be as clear as possible to avoid confusing the other person. Try, “I feel disrespected and uncomfortable when you come into my room unannounced. Please knock before entering.” A calm but firm tone lets the other person know you’re being serious but not disrespectful.\\n\\n[Read: Effective Communication]\\n\\nAddress feedback. Depending on the boundary, your partner may have questions for you. Know that you don’t need to justify your needs or explain yourself, but doing so may help the other person understand where you’re coming from. You might even ask follow-up questions to ensure the right message was conveyed.\\n\\nFeedback in romantic relationships\\n\\nIn romantic relationships, it’s especially important to ask your partner how they feel about a request, rather than guessing. Ask if it seems unfair or unusual to them. Or ask whether it conflicts with something they need or want.\\n\\nEach of you has your own thoughts and feelings, and each person is responsible for putting these sentiments into words in order to be understood.\\n\\nLet others take responsibility for their emotions. We often feel naturally inclined to care about how other people feel and react to our words and actions. However, you shouldn’t feel responsible for how the other person reacts to the boundary. For example, they might be upset that you’re asking for more “me time.” This could lead you to feel guilty or selfish. Remind yourself why you’re setting the restriction in the first place: You want some time alone to pursue your separate hobbies and avoid feeling emotionally crowded. Don’t feel you have to disregard your own needs.\\n\\nSpeak to a Licensed Therapist\\n\\nBetterHelp is an online therapy service that matches you to licensed, accredited therapists who can help with depression, anxiety, relationships, and more.

A partner might accidentally cross one or difficult family members might do so intentionally.\\n\\nRestate your needs. It’s possible that the other person didn’t understand your original request or simply forgot it. Be calm, firm, and clear about what you need.\\n\\nHave clear and reasonable consequences for crossing a boundary. If someone has a habit of talking over you, for example, you could say, “I feel disrespected when you talk over me. If you do that again, I’ll have to end the conversation.”\\n\\nOnly state consequences that you’re willing to enforce. If you aren’t willing to follow through on a consequence, the other person will feel empowered to overstep your boundaries in the future. For example, if you tell your partner that you’ll take a break from the relationship if they keep lying to you, it’s important to actually follow through on that.\\n\\nHow to respond when someone else sets a boundary\\n\\nYou’re not the only one who can set boundaries. When someone voices a restriction, you might feel a sense of shame or frustration. Perhaps you feel like you’re being reprimanded or “put in your place.”\\n\\nYou may notice some negative emotions rushing to the surface as you try to immediately defend your actions. Keep in mind that you are not losing anything but gaining knowledge of what makes the person in your life feel safe and happy.\\n\\nTake time to breathe and listen. If you’re feeling upset, deep, slow breathing can calm your nervous system’s “fight or flight” response. This makes it easier for you to receive information rather than prepare for an argument.\\n\\n[Read:Quick Stress Relief]\\n\\nAccept that the person setting the boundary knows what is best for them. If something truly doesn’t work for you, communicate your needs so that you can both reach a compromise.\\n\\nRemember that you both have your own way of processing and feeling emotions. Try not to assume what your partner needs before they say it out loud. Allow them space to voice their needs and wants.\\n\\nApologize when necessary. You’re only human, and we all make mistakes. Maybe you accidentally overstepped a boundary by making an offensive joke or oversharing when you’ve been asked not to. When someone reiterates the boundary, be humble enough to apologize for your mistake. Ask for clarity if you feel you need it.\\n\\nBy learning to accept and acknowledge other people’s boundaries, you can start to think about how you can improve your own connections with others. Ultimately, effective boundaries can leave you both feeling empowered and result in a healthier, more satisfying relationship.
